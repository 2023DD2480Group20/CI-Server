# DD2480 Assignment 2: CI-Server

### About

This is an assignment for the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals on KTH. This assignment's goal is to implement a Continuous Integration (CI) server that has the ability to automatically test a build and test code that was commited to a project's Github repository. The CI-server can then report the results back in the form of setting the commit status. 

### Features

### Build and Run

The project can be built and run with the commands (which also runs the test):

```
gradle build
gradle run
```

In order to only run the tests, one can run the command:
```
gradle test
```

This requires your system to have a valid gradle installation.
